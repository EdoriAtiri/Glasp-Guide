# Getting Started with Glasp - A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction to Glasp

When visiting websites, how often do you feel the need to take note of information that strikes a chord on such sites for future reference? Taking note of such content would usually see you use a different application or service like Evernote, Google Keep, Notion, Obsidian, or something similar. While organizing your points and thoughts this way works, it can be a rather tedious and unintuitive procedure. What if you could highlight quotes, leave notes, and save specific points on a website directly on the site without leaving your browser or visiting a different website or app?

Enter Glasp, a social highlighter extension available on Chrome and MacOS. With Glasp, you no longer have to switch to a different app to highlight and save a quote or take note of something you saw on a site. Even more, Glasp wants to remedy "knowledge isolation" and allows you to share your findings, highlights, and quotes through Glasp's social feature. This guide intends to walk you through how to install and set up Glasp and how you can take advantage of its features. The rest of the article is structured thus:
